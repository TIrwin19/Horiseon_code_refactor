# Horiseon_code_refactor

## Description
Update the Horiseon webpage index.html and style.css to current semantic standards.

-This will help future developers be able to read and navigate the code faster and easier.

-I also fixed the "Search Engine Optimization" link so it takes you to the section lowwer on the webpage.

-I learned that you must pa attention to the .css file as well to make sure that no elements need to be changed to match those changed in the .html file.
